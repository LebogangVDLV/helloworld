Wurkbox Prototype

Wurkbox is a collaboration learning system that will be used in schools by Teachers and Learners to collaborate remotely.

it was initially inspired by the Lockdown period were the studies most learners from economically disadvantaged areas we challenged.

the core point is to reinforce and maintain the strict yet healthy communication between the schools and their respective learners.

Leaders of the schools to have reports on each learner, teachers and/or associates.

In additions parents can conveniently intervene and contribute to the studies of their children and be in the know of their school life.

This allows reduces the cost to the schools as it should alos serve as a communication channel between the schools, SGBs, Learners and Parents.

Hope all works in order.
